“Our records indicate that you have not contacted us regarding mechanical coverage on the vehicle you purchased recently.
You are receiving this notice because a limited amount of time has been allotted to the expiration of your vehicle’s factory warranty coverage.
By neglecting to replace your coverage you will be at risk of being financially liable for any and all repairs after your factory warranty expires. However, you still may have time left to activate coverage on this vehicle before it’s too late. Final acceptance is subject to your ability to meet eligibility requirements.

[RECIPIENT BUSINESS NAME]
[RECIPIENT BUSINESS ADDRESS]
This is Richard Williams, Intellectual Property Attorney at Visionary Trademark. I am writing to inform you that we have received a trademark application for a business name identical to yours, [RECIPIENT BUSINESS NAME]. However, it appears that your business name is not registered federally with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), which allows others to proceed with their registration.
Please be advised that, under the protocols of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and intellectual property regulations, priority is generally given to the original business owner over subsequent applicants. Therefore, it is crucial to confirm whether you are interested in securing federal trademark rights for your business name.
If you wish to proceed with the registration, please respond to this email so we can guide you through the necessary steps.
Please be advised that if you choose not to register the trademark, the other applicant will be allowed to proceed, as the USPTO processes applications on a first-come, first-served basis.
Your prompt response is required. The other applicant's registration is currently on hold pending your decision till next two business days. If we do not receive a response to this letter, the other applicant will be allowed to proceed with their registration in accordance with the standard examination and filing procedures at the USPTO.
Pursuant to the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1051 et seq.), it is necessary to register your mark to secure federal ownership rights.
Looking forward to hear back from you.
Sincerely,
Richard G. Williams
Patent Attorney

This is a final notice regarding the trademark application for ""******** *********** *******"" As previously communicated, another party has initiated the trademark filing for this name. However, after conducting a detailed investigation, we discovered that they are a new startup with only a few months of usage of the name. On the other hand, your business has a well-established and proven history of using this name for a longer period.
As per our company’s policy, we are offering you first priority to file for the trademark, given your legitimate and proven use of the name. However, time is of the essence, and we require a response within 24 hours to proceed with the filing.
What happens next:
If you choose to proceed: We will immediately file your trademark application with CIPO to ensure full protection of your rights and ownership of the name.
If we do not hear from you: We will proceed with the other party’s filing, as CIPO follows a first-come, first-served policy.
If the other party successfully registers the trademark, they will gain exclusive rights to the name, and you will no longer have the legal right to use it. Under Canada’s Trade-marks Act, this could lead to potential trademark infringement claims, legal penalties, financial damages, and even a lawsuit for continued use of the name. Furthermore, the other party may issue a cease-and-desist order, severely disrupting your business operations.
We strongly urge you to take swift action to protect your rights. If we do not hear from you within 24 hours, we will proceed with the other party’s application, as we cannot hold the filing indefinitely.
If you have any questions or would like to proceed, please reply to this email or contact me directly at our front desk at (778) 769-0180. Please provide your full name and business name to the operator so they can connect you with me.

This is Kristine reaching out.
So many people want to use GLP-1 for health benefits and weight loss. Maybe you are one of them. Medicines like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus are expensive and hard to get ahold of.
We can help you.
I am a health specialist with GetReliefRX, a small group of doctors, pharmacists, and health coaches out of Billings, MT. Unlike other groups, we are offering you:
- A $0 medical consultation
- All our medicines are oral gels - no shots, no pills, high absorption
- Only $149 for your first month of medicine
- 3 choices of GLP-1s - Rybelsus, Generic Semaglutide, Tirzepatide
- $0 Health coaching
Why are we so cost effective and why do we offer so many benefits that others don't? Because we are grounded in the medical benefits of GLP-1s, and we truly want to help people with affordable solutions.
You can learn more about GetReliefRX by going to https://getreliefrx.com/glp1/?utm_source=5345444.
If you are interested, you can simply reply YES to this message and I will text you back.

899679,"Hello,
I received the following text today (Wednesday 10/9/2024). I coincidentally went to a USPS earlier today, which I seldom do, to deliver an online retail return for my mother to send back to the seller. Unfortunately, I did fall for it. I was prompted to enter in information at the link for her home address, phone number, and e-mail. I entered these in then on the next screen was asked for a $0.23 payment to cover the package re-sending fee. I entered my credit card number then submit, but nothing happened. I then tried it using my debit card, and nothing happened either. I then realized (too late) that the link in the text message didn't look right. I have a feeling I was phished. I called my bank and canceled all my cards and requested replacements. I am now afraid for my parents after putting in my mother's address believing that USPS couldn't read her address on the package (reasons I thought they were sending me the text). Does this put the safety of my parents at risk since I inputted their home address?

Our records indicate that you are eligible to receive restitution for one or more of the Internet fraud schemes of which you have been a victim. Please see the necessary case details below. Case about detained internet scammers from African countries who were arrested for serious crimes.
The case was closed based on the following terms:
Restitution order: the seized assets will be liquidated and converted into a restitution fund.
Time served plus 10 years probation means all scammers will be in jail for the next 10 years.
The perpetrator and his accomplices had more than 2,000 aliases from Russia, Nigeria, Ghana, London and many African countries that masked their original identities. Our records indicates that you have been a victim of fraud because your contact details were found on several devices belonging to the perpetrator.
Following court orders, this makes you eligible to receive restitution for the damages caused by this criminal being that (subject) operated on an international scale and victimized thousands of people and companies of various nationalities. We determined that the investigation should be kept private and away from public media to maintain a unitary approach and integrity in international relations. Because this was a private investigation, all victims (including you) were represented by a court-appointed professional public defender(Law Firm) with more than 10 years of experience in similar cases. Having consistently pursued the (subjects) case for two years, he successfully achieved restitution payments of $25 million for each victim.

I responded with this SMS: “ Hello

Don't you want to inspect the trailer and learn more about it?
This seems a little suspicious as you're ready to pay but haven't even seen the camper.

I have owned my business for 30 years, but have only had my current business name since 2017. On 10/25/24, I replied to his email, called him, left a message, called my lawyers, left a message. He called me back same day, sounded only moderately legitimate. I explained I was waiting on my own lawyers. He emailed me again today 10/29/24, stressing he would need to file for me or give my business name away. I immediately replied to his email, and stated I couldn't find information about him with the supplied web link and google searched his actual location, which was listed as an apartment. He replied with a clearly fake web page (I reverse image searched, and ""handsome lawyer"" stock images appeared). None of the information he supplied made sense once I started researching it. I also realized that the original web url was purchased this month. At first glance this seems legitimate, so I'm reporting it to save other businesses the time and effort to avoid this scam.

890285,"""Hi.
This is the last warning.
I hacked your operating system.
All personal data from your devices has been copied to my servers. I have access to your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history and contact list.
My virus constantly updates signatures (it is driver-based) so it remains invisible to antivirus software.
While collecting information about you, I found out that you are a big fan of adult websites.
You really like to visit porn sites and watch dirty videos while having an orgasm.
I've already made a screen capture.
It's a montage of the pornographic video you were watching at the time and your masturbation.
Your face is perfectly visible.I do not think this kind of content will have a positive impact on your reputation.
I can send this video to everyone who knows you.
I also have no problem with making all of your personal information public on the Internet.
I think you know what I mean. It would be a real disaster for you. I could ruin your life forever.
I think you really do not want that to happen.
Let's solve it this way: you transfer me 1300 dollars (USD) (in Bitcoin equivalent at the exchange rate at the moment of funds transfer), and I will immediately remove all this dirt from my servers. After that we will forget about each other.
Bitcoin wallet for payment:
1Bkka7HcZ1noLpS94gpcvwsYMr2BoZUtkX
(If you do not know how to transfer money and what Bitcoin is. Use Google.)
I give you 2 working days to transfer the money. The timer started automatically as soon as you opened the email. I will receive a notification about the opening of this email.
Do not try to complain anywhere, as there is no way to track the wallet, the mail from where the letter came, and is not tracked and created automatically, so there is no point in writing to me.
Do not try to contact the police and other security services, otherwise your data will be published.
Changing passwords in social networks, mail, device will not help you, because all the data is already downloaded to a cluster of my servers.
Good luck and do not do anything stupid. Think about your future.""",,"WI, USA- 53212",Unknown Location,cotato@mocbrasil.com,Unknown Phone Number,yahoo.com/email,"September 14, 2024",Phishing,Unknown,"{'Fear and Intimidation': ""This is the last warning.

This is Brian Collins, IP Attorney at Matrix IPO. We would like to inform you that we have received a trademark application for a business name identical to yours ********* ********. Should this application proceed, and the applicant secures federal ownership and protection for the trademark, you would be required to cease all usage of this name in accordance with the Patent & Custom Law and the United States Trademark Law.
The application is currently being processed with the United States Patent & Trademark Office for trademark registration. During our research in the IP databases, your information was identified. According to USPTO and intellectual property protocols, priority is generally given to the original user of the business name/mark over a new applicant. Thus, we are reaching out to ascertain your interest in securing federal trademark rights for your business name.
If you do not wish to register the trademark, we will proceed with the federal registration for the other applicant, as trademarks are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis rather than first use.
We kindly request your prompt response, as the other applicant’s registration process is currently on hold pending your decision. If we do not hear from you within the next two business days, we will proceed with the registration for the other applicant according to the standard examination and filing procedures of the USPTO.
As stipulated by the Lanham Act (Act of 1946, §§ 1051 et seq.), federal registration is mandatory to secure ownership rights.
Sincerely,
Brian D. Collins

I wanted to bring to your attention that, according to CIPO (Canadian Intellectual Property Office) records, the business name "" CRRAL.com "" is currently not trademarked and does not appear in the records of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. As per legal considerations, a name not trademarked is regarded as an open entity available for registration or trademarking by any entity within the Canada. The duration a company has been using the name holds less significance than the validity of the trademark itself. If another company or individual secures the trademark before you do, they will have an advantage, irrespective of the duration of your current usage.
Upon our research, we noted that your company has been using this business name for several years, and our applicant has also been utilizing the name for the past couple of years. Considering this, we would like to offer you our trademark services. Our aim is to assist you in securing your business name and identity through trademark registration, ensuring 100% ownership rights under your ownership.
Operating without trademark protection poses significant risks to your company. Without legal barriers in place, other businesses could use the same name, leading to confusion among customers and potential dilution of your brand identity. Moreover, if the other company successfully trademarks the name, they could gain exclusive rights to its use, forcing your company to rebrand at considerable expense.
According to our company policy, we prioritize applicants who have a more established and legitimate usage of the business name compared to our current applicant, who is a startup business. Given your extensive history in the industry, we believe you deserve full ownership of your business name. We're eager to assist you in securing 100% ownership rights under your name. Based on our research, it's evident that you are more deserving of ownership compared to the current applicant. Let us help you protect your brand and ensure its longevity in the market.
Our team consists of professional intellectual property attorneys, each possessing over a decade of experience in their respective fields. If you are interested, we can discuss the detailed process and associated costs at your convenience. I am open to discussing this matter further and addressing any questions or concerns you may have.

Hello [target name removed],
Thanks for your message.
The Yamaha Baby Grand Piano GC1 model used to be owned and played by my husband who passed away last year, the dimension is ""161cm by 149cm”. It was last tuned two months ago. She's about 3 years old and in an impeccable condition.
I'm relocating to France next two weeks, and I don't think my husband will be happy if I sell this piano, so I'm hoping to give it out to someone who is a passionate lover of the instrument, I wasn't going to leave it alone in an empty house.
The Piano is currently in storage in Calgary, AB with the movers I employed to move my properties from my house. I can forward you the movers’ contact details to enable you to contact them. The movers can deliver anywhere. However, I will not be responsible for the cost of delivering the piano to you. However, the movers' rates are reasonably affordable.
I look forward to your reply.

917171,"Received the following porn blackmail email notification to my work email account
""Hello pervert,
I want to inform you about a very bad situation for you. However, you can benefit from it, if you will act wisely.
Have you heard of Pegasus?
This is a spyware program that installs on computers and smartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners.
It provides access to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on Android, iOS, and Windows.
I guess, you already figured out where I'm getting at.
It's been a few months since I installed it on all your devices because you were not quite choosy about what links to click on the internet.
During this period, I've learned about all aspects of your private life, but one is of special significance to me.
I've recorded many videos of you jerking off to highly controversial porn videos.
Given that the ""questionable"" genre is almost always the same, I can conclude that you have sick perversion.
I doubt you'd want your friends, family and co-workers to know about it. However, I can do it in a few clicks.
Every number in your contact book will suddenly receive these videos - on WhatsApp, on Telegram, on Skype, on email - everywhere.
It is going to be a tsunami that will sweep away everything in its path, and first of all, your former life.
Don't think of yourself as an innocent victim. No one knows where your perversion might lead in the future, so consider this a kind of deserved punishment to stop you.
Better late than never.
I'm some kind of God who sees everything.
However, don't panic. As we know, God is merciful and forgiving, and so do I.
But my mercy is not free.
Transfer $1400 USD to my bitcoin wallet: bc1qzvfq7t8lzjdfxe2ehcuqcfqwygp77rus496a05
Once I receive confirmation of the transaction, I will permanently delete all videos compromising you, uninstall Pegasus from all of your devices, and disappear from your life. You can be sure - my benefit is only money.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be writing to you but destroy your life without a word in a second.
I'll be notified when you open my email, and from that moment you have exactly 48 hours to send the money.
If cryptocurrencies are unchartered waters for you, don't worry, it's very simple.
Just google ""crypto exchange"" and then it will be no harder than buying some useless stuff on Amazon.
I strongly warn you against the following:) Do not reply to this email. I sent it from a temp email, so I am untraceable.) Do not contact the police. I have access to all your devices, and as soon as I find out you ran to the cops, videos will be published.) Don't try to reset or destroy your devices.
As I mentioned above: I'm monitoring all your activity, so you either agree to my terms or the videos are published.
Also, don't forget that cryptocurrencies are anonymous, so it's impossible to identify me using the provided address.
Good luck, my perverted friend. I hope this is the last time we hear from each other.

I received your email and thanks for your concern. The piano is still available. Please I'm giving out the Piano as a gift. Please attached to this email are the pictures of the instrument (Piano) just in case.
Now that you have seen the pictures of the piano, still interested in receiving it as a gift? I need to know before more information can be sent to you.
I will be expecting to receive your response.
Regards, Mary.
Hello,
I received your email. Have tried gifting out the piano locally before, but they all keep complaining of not having enough space and the storage fee I paid on the piano was getting close to the expiration date. So, I'm happy to be gifting it out now.
Anyway, the Yamaha Baby Grand Piano GC1 model used to be owned and played by my late husband, who sadly passed away late last year. The dimensions of the piano are ""161cm by 149cm,"" and it was last tuned sometime before his passing. She's about 2 years old now and It's almost brand new, everything is working perfectly and sounding very well. So, you don't have anything to worry about having been well cared for by my late husband, who cherished it deeply.
As I am relocating to France and downsizing my living space, I am seeking to find a new home for the piano. I believe my late husband would want it to go to someone who shares his passion for music. I cannot bear to leave it behind in an empty house. Additionally, I am facing health issues and I will be undergoing surgery in the coming days, which is why it is crucial for the piano to find a new owner soon.
Currently, the piano is in storage in Little Rock, Arkansas, with the movers I hired for moving my properties. They are professional and can deliver the piano to your address without stress or damage. However, I will not be responsible for the cost of delivery the piano to your address and the mover's rates are reasonably affordable because of the storage charges i paid on the piano.
So, you are to reply back to this email as soon as possible before we can proceed because you need to be fine with this before I can get across to the movers and let them know about you and also send you the contact of the movers.
I will be waiting to receive your response.
Regards,
Mary.
Hello Michael,
I received your email.  I can understand. As regards delivery to your location, the movers are highly professional and the delivery fee is affordable due to the storage fee I paid on the piano. Anyway, I just sent the moving company a message and instructed them to release the piano to you and they shall also inform you about the actual cost to get it delivered to your provided address.
So, all you need to do now is to contact them via email and make an arrangement regarding the moving of the piano to your address. I would like you to take some pictures/videos when they arrive at your address.

Hi David,
Thank you for your kind words. I’m so glad to hear that you and Ashley are interested.
Storing the piano until late September or early October is not a problem, so you can rest easy on that front. I just sent the moving company a message and instructed them to release the piano to you. All you need to do now is to contact them and make an arrangement regarding the moving process. I would like you to take some pictures/videos when they arrive at your address.

Hi Gina,
That’s really wonderful. I’ll certainly bring this up with my fiancée, Ashley. I think we’re both quite interested.
If you’d be willing to forward the movers’ information to me, I’d be grateful to inquire about their moving costs. This is such a generous way to honor your late husband. I’d be delighted to learn more about his life and history with and love for music if you’d be willing to share.
Again, I would not be able to take possession of it until late September or early October, but if the storage until then is not a problem, and if the moving costs are reasonable, I’d gladly pay the delivery fee.
Many thanks and all best,

Hello David,
Thanks for your message.
The Yamaha Baby Grand Piano GC1 model used to be owned and played by my husband who passed away last year, the dimension is ""161cm by 149cm”. It was last tuned two months ago. She's about 3 years old and in an impeccable condition.
I'm relocating to France next two weeks, and I don't think my husband will be happy if I sell this piano, so I'm hoping to give it out to someone who is a passionate lover of the instrument, and you can have it if you want it or forward my email/pictures to anyone who’s interested in the instrument. I wasn't going to leave it alone in an empty house.
The Piano is currently in storage in Little Rock, Arkansas with the movers I employed to move my properties from my house. I can forward you the movers’ contact details to enable you to contact them. The movers can deliver anywhere. I have attached pictures of the instrument for you. However, I will not be responsible for the cost of delivering the piano to you. However, the movers' rates are reasonably affordable.
I look forward to your reply.

mike super,
I know that calling 7152893540 or visiting 653 tower dr would be a effective way to contact you if you don't take
action. Don't even try to hide from this. You've no idea what I'm capable of in cadott.
It's important you pay attention to this message right now. Take a moment to chill, breathe, and analyze it thoroughly. 'Cause
we're about to discuss a deal between you and me, and I ain't playing games. You do not know me but I know you very well
and you must be wondering how, right?
Well, you've been treading on thin ice with your browsing habits, scrolling through those videos and venturing into the darker
corners of cyberspace. I actually placed a Malware on a porn website and you accessed it to watch(know what I mean?).
When you were watching videos, your smartphone began functioning as a RDP (Remote Device) which provided me with
total access to your device. I can look at everything on your display, switch on your camera and mic, and you wouldn't have a
clue. Oh, and I have got access to all your emails, contacts, and social media accounts too.
Been keeping tabs on your pathetic life for a while now. It is just your hard luck that I found your blunder. I put in more days
than I should have investigating into your personal life. Extracted quite a bit of juicy info from your system. and I've seen it all.
Yeah, Yeah, I've got footage of you doing embarrassing things in your room (nice setup, by the way). I then developed videos
and screenshots where on one side of the screen, there's the videos you were watching, and on the other part, it is someone
doing naughty things. With just a click, I can send this garbage to all of your contacts.
I feel your worry and confusion. Frankly, I am ready to wipe the slate clean, and allow you to move on with your life and wipe
your slate clean. I will offer you two alternatives.
First Choice is to ignore this mail. You should know what will happen if you pick this path. Your video will get sent to your
entire contacts. The video is straight fire, and I can't even fathom the embarrasement you'll endure when your colleagues,
friends, and fam check it out. But hey, that's life, ain't it? Don't be playing the victim here.
Option 2 is to pay me, and be confidential about it. Weâ€™ll name this my â€oeconfidentiality tipâ€ . Now Lets see what will
happen when you select this path. Your dirty secret remains private. I will wipe everything clean once you send payment. You
will make the payment via Bitcoin only. I want you to know I'm aiming for a win-win here. I will keep my end of the bargain.
Amount to be sent: USD 2000
BTC ADDRESS IS: bc1ql83unwz925jjm2tjc36ltzd2369yjx48j4aj6z
Let me tell ya, it's peanuts for your peace.
And of course: You got one day to sort this out and I will only accept Bitcoin. I have a unique pixel in this email, and now
I've been notified that you have read through this email message. This email and Bitcoin address are custom-made for you,
untraceable. If you are unfamiliar with Bitcoin, google it. You can buy it online or through a Bitcoin ATM in your
neighborhood. There's no point in replying to this email or negotiating, it's pointless my price is fixed. As soon as you send the
complete payment, my system will inform me and I will wipe out all the dirt I got on you. Remember if I suspect that you've
shared or discussed this message with anyone else, your video will instantly start getting sent to your contacts and I will post a
physical tape to all of your neighborhood next week. And don't even think about turning off your phone or resetting it to
factory settings, I already have all your data. I don't make mistakes, mike.

He stated even though we have been using the name longer, if another company registers for a trademark on the name that you will not be able to use the name anymore if their trademark is approved. Below is the first email, and below is the follow-up email after I replied to the first message stating that we plan to continue using the company name and provide me with the necessary steps.

Subject: Trademark Conflict, immediate action required
**** ****** I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out on behalf of the Legal Department at Elite Mark Group, a private firm specializing in trademark and copyright legal services. We’ve recently received a request from an applicant in North Carolina who wants to trademark a name that is identical to “Streamer"" which you are currently using for similar services. Our preliminary investigation indicates that you have been using this business name for quite some time. In accordance with our company policy, we prioritize the rights of established businesses over those of newcomers.
According to the USPTO records, the name “Streamer"" is not currently trademarked and does not appear in the United States Patent & Trademark Office database. Legally, if a name isn’t trademarked, it is available for registration by anyone in the U.S., regardless of how long it has been in use. The key factor is the existence of a valid trademark; if another party registers the trademark before you, they will have a legal edge, even if you’ve been using the name longer.
Federal trademark registration grants the holder ownership rights and may limit your ability to use the name “Streamer"" They could also take legal action against you, which might lead to claims on any profits you’ve made under that name.
Please let me know if you intend to use this name legally in the future, so I can assist you with the necessary steps. It’s important to remember that, as outlined in the Lanham Act of 1946 (§§ 1051 et seq), federal registration is crucial for establishing ownership rights.
Your prompt attention to this matter is vital for protecting your rights and avoiding any potential legal complications. We look forward to your response.

Subject: Final Confirmation Required: Urgent Action Needed for Trademark Registration of Your Business Name
**** ***** Trust this correspondence finds you in good health.
This serves as our conclusive attempt to communicate with you regarding the formal registration of the business name ""Streamer"" Failure to receive your confirmation for registration by the end of today will necessitate our progression with an alternative applicant by tomorrow, potentially resulting in the forfeiture of your entitlement to utilize the  “Streamer"".
In adherence to our meticulous trademark registration procedures, we conduct comprehensive assessments on search engines and social media platforms to ascertain the distinctiveness of the brand name. Absent confirmation from the current user within the specified 24 to 48 business hours, we will proceed with the interested party's registration.
Trademark conflict constitutes a breach of civil laws, with potential repercussions involving court-ordered cessation of trademark usage. Furthermore, financial restitution may be mandated, encompassing the surrender of profits derived from the infringing use or payment of monetary damages. The penalties for trademark infringement may include injunctive relief or the issuance of a cease-and-desist directive.
Recognizing your historical utilization of the brand for an extended period, we acknowledge the possibility of exercising discretion in refraining from legal proceedings with the alternate party, particularly if they represent a startup entity. If your intention is to assert ownership of the business name ""Streamer,"" a swift response is imperative to facilitate guidance through the registration process.
Your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated, and we anticipate your expeditious response.

917898,"Received said email this morning, Wednesday, December 4, 2024 at 07:57 AM from a M,s. Kylie Gomez, allegedly from, ""Integrity Publishing, LLC.""  The referenced email was sent to my email:  ********************** with the heading, ""Amazon's Book Recommendation.""
The following is the body of the email content:
""Dear ***** ******* Your published book has been forwarded to us by Amazon who is the distributor of your book across America and the rest of the world, and it is chosen for a republishing opportunity here at Integrity Publishing.  Having said that, Amazon saw potential in your book not just based on your credentials and credibility but because of the book's quality.  We are also willing to partly invest in your book, so you won't have to worry that much.  However, those interested in your book have some concerns about your book being expensive, price wise, making it difficult for bookstores to see benefits in buying and selling it.  Almost all printers in the US would confirm that the cost of printing your book is far too low compared to the retail price set by your publisher which is so much for the buyers to handle.
With this in mind, as per recommendation we would like to let you know that we can get your book republished and printed at the price of your preference basing on its printing cost so you could sell your book at the most competitive book price to your buyers without having to sacrifice everything that you have done for your book and don't worry because you will still have a full control on your book from production to publication.
This demand and interest being shown to your book is now the effect of your efforts on continuously marketing your project.
Looking forward to discussing the details so we can make it happen.  If you are interested, please respond in this email with your active phone number and physical address.

Facts:  Although I have written a book that was broken into two separate books, the only publishing that occurred both times, I had the entire copies printed out respectively being at:  Poteau, Oklahoma Public Library and Office Depot in Tukwila, WA.
I do have an Amazon account that I just took off, ""pause hiatus,"" as of yesterday but, said account is of personal use and has never said anything about my books.
I have had some of my, ""opinion,"" writings published in the forms of:  Letter to the Editor (SouthWest Times, Fort Smith, AR), a few online articles:  Chicken Soup for the Soul, a roller derby magazine and most recently on a website for Survivor's of Traumatic Childhood Abuse and some poetry here and there.
I also wrote the team mantra still being used at present for the LeFlore County Maidens of Mayhem of Poteau, Oklahoma and a few personal funeral eulogies and pamphlet poems distributed.
Upon reading the email mentioned above, I found it too coincidental that the name was a mix of two (2) social celebrities well known around all social platforms as well as in Hollywood and the music industry etc.:  Kylie Jenner and Selena Gomez.  I also knew that my books had NEVER BEEN published by any company and definitely NOT by Amazon.  I did click on the website link out of curiosity where as soon as the website loaded, noticed the word, ""quote,"" was spelled incorrectly (red flag for a publishing company) and quickly exited the website and upon reading the email again, I also noticed multiple grammatical errors etc.
Also, in this email the address stated for the company does NOT contain or list the actual address but instead, lists the street name, city and state only obviously also leaving the zip code out as well.
I then started researching Ms. Kylie and her company where I came across the previous submission on this website prior to mine now.
I also want to add that I found another interesting coincidence:  The phone number given for Ms. Kylie, ************ eerily enough contains *** which is my current first three (3) ***** ** ** ***** ****** ***** *** **** **** ***** *** *** *** **** **** ****** *** *** **** *** **** ******* *** **** **** *** ** ** ******** ***** ****** **** ***** ** *** ******* ** * ** *** ******** **** ***** **** **** ***** * **** ******* * ***** *** *** *****",,"WA, USA- 98198","Lady Lake, FL",kyliegomez@integrity-publishingllc.com,(352) 247-7906,https://integrity-publishing.com,"December 4, 2024",Phishing,Integrity Publishing LLC,"{'Authority and Impersonation': ""allegedly from, 'Integrity Publishing, LLC.'; Your published book has been forwarded to us by Amazon who is the distributor of your book across America and the rest of the world; Amazon saw potential in your book not just based on your credentials and credibility but because of the book's quality; we would like to let you know that we can get your book republished and printed at the price of your preference ... you will still have a full control on your book from production to publication; Senior Marketing & Publishing Consultant; Address: Harbor Hills Blvd Lady Lake FL"", 'Phantom Riches': ""Amazon saw potential in your book not just based on your credentials and credibility but because of the book's quality; We are also willing to partly invest in your book, so you won't have to worry that much; This demand and interest being shown to your book is now the effect of your efforts on continuously marketing your project; we can get your book republished and printed at the price of your preference ... you could sell your book at the most competitive book price to your buyers"", 'Pretext and trust': ""Your published book has been forwarded to us by Amazon; The referenced email was sent to my email...with the heading, 'Amazon's Book Recommendation.'; Having said that, Amazon saw potential in your book ...; We are also willing to partly invest in your book, so you won't have to worry that much; those interested in your book have some concerns about your book being expensive, price wise, making it difficult for bookstores to see benefits in buying and selling it; If you are interested, please respond in this email with your active phone number and physical address.""}"
912107,"I am writing to bring to your attention serious concerns regarding the business practices of **FVAChatting.com** (""FVAChatting"") that may warrant regulatory scrutiny. Based on a detailed review of their publicly available **Terms of Service (https://www.fvachatting.com/terms)**, **Privacy Policy (https://www.fvachatting.com/privacy)**, and marketing statements on their website, I respectfully request that your office investigate whether FVAChatting is operating in compliance with state and federal consumer protection and privacy laws.
The information available suggests that FVAChatting may be engaging in deceptive practices and failing to adequately protect consumer privacy, particularly with regard to interactions involving OnlyFans subscribers. My concerns center around the potential misrepresentation of their services, misleading consumer interactions, and questionable data collection practices that may affect your residents.
### 1. Potentially Deceptive Practices Under the FTC Act
The **Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act)** prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce ([15 U.S.C. § 45](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/what-we-do/enforcement-authority)). Deceptive practices are defined as material misrepresentations or omissions that are likely to mislead a reasonable consumer ([FTC v. Cyberspace.com LLC, 453 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir. 2006)]).
- **Concern**: FVAChatting markets its services with claims such as:
> “Outsource Your OnlyFans Chatting Today”
> “Clone Your Persona: Our chatters will clone your persona and work on scaling your account.”
> “Get 5x more sales in OnlyFans Chatting. At FVA Chatting, we don't just chat, we charm, we captivate, we create cash flows.”
These statements imply that OnlyFans models (account holders) are directly engaging with their fans. However, the **Terms of Service (https://www.fvachatting.com/terms)** and **Privacy Policy (https://www.fvachatting.com/privacy)** reveal that interactions are conducted by representatives hired by FVAChatting who impersonate the models without disclosing this to subscribers.
- **Impact on Consumers**: Many subscribers may be under the impression they are interacting directly with the models when, in fact, they are speaking to hired representatives. This lack of transparency can significantly influence consumer decisions, potentially violating the FTC Act.
- **Relevant Legal Precedents**:
- In **FTC v. Willow Labs LLC (2017)**, the court found that misleading representations about the nature of a service violated the FTC Act.
- The **FTC v. Cyberspace.com LLC (2006)** case underscores that failure to disclose critical information, particularly where it affects consumer behavior, can constitute a deceptive practice.
### 2. Potential Violations of State Consumer Protection Laws (California and New York)
**California Business and Professions Code § 17200 (Unfair Competition Law)** and **New York General Business Law § 349** prohibit deceptive or unfair business practices.
- **California**: The **Privacy Policy (https://www.fvachatting.com/privacy)** indicates that FVAChatting collects extensive personal data, including sensitive information such as social security numbers and passport details. However, the purpose behind collecting such sensitive data is not clearly explained. The marketing statements such as **“Get 5x more sales”** may mislead consumers into believing they are directly interacting with the models, rather than hired representatives.
- **Legal Precedent**: The California Supreme Court in **Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011)** affirmed that consumers misled by deceptive marketing practices have standing to sue under the Unfair Competition Law. Similarly, **People v. JTH Tax, Inc. (2013)** emphasized that deceptive business practices can result in significant legal consequences.
- **New York**: Statements suggesting direct communication with models, such as **“propelling creators to the zenith of OnlyFans success”**, could be seen as deceptive under **New York General Business Law § 349**, which prohibits practices likely to mislead consumers.
- **Legal Precedent**: In **Gaidon v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America (1999)**, the court found that misleading practices materially affecting consumers’ decisions violated state law.
### 3. Privacy and Data Protection Concerns Under the CCPA/CPRA
The **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** and **California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)** provide California residents with rights over their personal data, including the right to know what data is collected and how it is used.
- **Concern**: The Privacy Policy at **https://www.fvachatting.com/privacy** discloses that FVAChatting collects extensive data, including **IP addresses, passport numbers, and device identifiers**, but does not adequately explain why this information is necessary for chat services.
- **Potential Non-Compliance**: The CCPA requires companies to clearly disclose their data collection practices and allow consumers to opt out of the sale of their personal data. FVAChatting’s vague language around the purposes of data collection may not align with these legal requirements.
- **Relevant Legal Precedent**: In **People v. Equifax Inc. (2020)**, California regulators enforced penalties for inadequate disclosures related to sensitive data collection.
### 4. Potential Non-Compliance with the GDPR
If FVAChatting processes the personal data of EU residents, it may be subject to the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**. The **Schrems II (2020)** decision emphasized the need for robust safeguards when transferring personal data outside the EU.
- **Concern**: The Privacy Policy suggests that data may be transferred internationally, potentially without adequate protection, which could violate GDPR requirements.
### 5. Lack of Clear Contact Information
The **Privacy Policy** only lists a generic support email (**support@fvachatting.com**) with no physical address or phone number. This lack of transparency may not comply with the **California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)**, which mandates clear contact information for consumer inquiries.
### Request for Investigation
Based on the concerns outlined above, I respectfully request that your office investigate whether FVAChatting’s practices comply with:
- The **Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act)**
- **California Business and Professions Code § 17200** and **New York General Business Law § 349**
- The **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** and **California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)**
- The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, if applicable
- The **Lanham Act** regarding false advertising
### Conclusion
The potentially misleading practices and privacy concerns described above suggest that FVAChatting’s actions may have significant implications for consumers, particularly those who believe they are engaging directly with OnlyFans models. While I may not be a resident of your state, the potentially inappropriate business practices by FVAChatting could impact your residents who need your protection. I urge your office to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that FVAChatting complies with all applicable laws.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.",$100,"CA, USA- 90005","Los Angeles, CA",support@fvachatting.com,Unknown Phone Number,https://www.fvachatting.com,"November 16, 2024",Phishing,Unknown,"{'Authority and Impersonation': 'Our chatters will clone your persona and work on scaling your account. ... interactions are conducted by representatives hired by FVAChatting who impersonate the models without disclosing this to subscribers.', 'Liking': ""At FVA Chatting, we don't just chat, we charm, we captivate, we create cash flows. ...

896760,"The person (***** *****l) used this email address to contact me: info@demopharm.org
The person (James O'Neal) claimed he was deaf and could only talk on Microsoft Teams; then, he did an online interview asking me questions to make him seem legit. Then, he offered me a job and stated that the company would pay for the office equipment, but he said that the money given to me was actually from a company in the U.S. that owed them money. He asked for my info, and I gave him my SSN, Drivers License, 2 of my credit cards, my address, personal friends, and phone numbers. All my identification information was given. He then asked me for my bank numbers; however, I did not provide that information. I gave him my credit login info on both of my credit cards because he said that I had to go out and purchase the office equipment with the money he credited to my credit cards. He also sent via email an acceptance welcome letter that did not specify what exactly were my duties at this company. He has credited the money to my credit cards, however I was told by several people that they purchase the office equipment with a fake check that was sent to them via mobile banking. Then, I further research this company, which is listed on a trusted job website which is Indeed.com), and found out that they have stolen information from a company and used it as a front for their scam. I asked the scammer to contact me via phone, and he refused. He did not answer the last question I asked which was can you call me. There is now a credit on my credit cards but I have not used the money. I asked him if he could send the money via CashApp, and he refused. The hourly wage that the company offer was $32.85 per hour. The following is a segment of the conversation, and this is what the scammer said:
(The company will provide you with a free new MacBook Pro laptop with a fast internet connection. You will get started with work as soon as your working materials and software are available.
You will be making an order for this software which you will be using to start work with. The vendor will install the software programs on the MacBook before mailing them to you, and the payment receipts and equipment will have your name on them because the equipment will become yours after 3-5 months of working with us. The training supervisor assigned to you will take you through those soft-wares. He will train you on how to use the software programs and when to use them. The software programs will be ready and active on your PC to enable you to work accurately with him
The working materials are the major equipment that you will be needing to set up a mini-office with. The working materials and equipment include all wooden materials and machines. The wooden materials are the office chair and table, and the office cabinet as well, if need be, etc. Do you understand?)
He then said the following:
As we commence with the preparations for your training, the company will issue you a check to enable you purchase all the office equipment and software's required to begin work with. You won't be required to reimburse the company for the check/equipment, but rather it will be the property of the company for the duration of your employment. Okay ?)
(Once you receive the check you are required to deposit it into your bank account. The money will typically be available in your account the next day, in the morning (24hrs) or less. Also, once the deposit is available, you are to deduct the $150.00 as your sign on bonus and the rest of the funds in your account will be for the purchase of your working  softwares, I will instruct you to purchase your working materials/equipment from the company's accredited/certified vendors at a discount rate because of the company's long-lasting relationship and agreement with them. We have reasons for this because the company specifies the software and office equipment. The vendor must install the software programs on the laptop before mailing them to you. Also, we will customize all materials in your name and the Company Logo and ship them to you via FedEx or DHL Global Logistics...Do you understand?)
(The check may be issued out by any of our 45 affiliated companies who owes Demo Pharmaceuticals some amount of money so this automatically serves as our refund as it is used solely for the benefit of our employees. I believe am understood?)
(For easier and faster process to enable you commence work asap and start earning your pay, The accounting department has decided to send you the check for your working material to you via email, You will be required to deposit the check electronically using your mobile banking app, Funds will be made available instantly or next day as soon as you deposit the check, you will be required to send a screen shot of the deposit confirmation receipt with your account number hidden for record purposes. Do you understand my instructions?)
This whole process did not make sense to me AT ALL.
Please alert others that this is a scam to get your personal and banking information. They will have you purchase the items and then reverse the credited payment. Others who have been victims of this company use fake checks, and the victim purchases the items; then, they are on the hook for the money they spend from their accounts. Please do something about this scammer. This is horrible, and my identity might be stolen at this point.

From 24 November
I sincerely apologize for the delayed response; I’ve been occupied with parking.
I've spoken with the movers, the representative recommended that you connect with an agent through the live chat on their website at https://www.nationalamericanlogistics.com to initiate the reroute. Provide the Referral ID:  KP23101DWF and mention that Dr Katherine referred  you. Please keep me posted on how things progress with the movers.

? Dear Katherine,
Very much hope to hear from you today. Just combining my two emails of yesterday.
Firstly, Thank you for what feels like an incredibly generous offer. Incredibly generous.
We are so touched by this gesture of you wanting to keep the music playing and accessible to the youth. I am really delighted you are interested in us taking custody of your piano.
We feel it would be prudent to have one of our musicians just come by and briefly play it if possible - before we arrange to move forward and pay the movers to deliver. I don’t want to make a problem for you, as i’m sure you have many things to organise, but we would like to test it very much before committing.
Would this be possible? We could visit the movers facility perhaps?
Also for your movers information

If you're interested in it.
Could you please share your address and phone number so I can pass it along to them to plan the route and calculate the cost? I also want to inform you that they require payment before delivery, as it's their policy to collect payment upfront to cover expenses related to disassembling and assembling the piano, delivery, and insurance. The charges should be minimal since I've already covered the main costs, you’ll only need to pay the difference.

Dear Katherine,
I am very so sorry for your loss, which was so recently and I wanted to give our warm wishes to you and respect for getting things organised so fast.
Before being able to comment and ask you to speak to your movers, are you able to give
me a little more on the model, as we have a size issue and am concerned what you have which I think is a full Grand - may be too big without us removing windows.
If you can give me the model I can check the size on the internet.

Hello ****, Thank you for your interest in the piano. The Steinway belonged to my late husband, who played it as recently as February before his passing. While I’m in the process of moving my belongings, I know my husband, with his deep love and attachment to the instrument, wouldn’t have wanted it to be sold. I’m hoping to pass it on to someone who shares his passion for music and has a genuine love for the piano.
The first person I had in mind unfortunately didn’t follow through, and since I don’t intend to sell it, the piano is currently with the movers handling my relocation. However, if you’re interested, I can try to arrange for the movers to reroute it to you. It shouldn’t incur too much additional cost, as the distance can be covered within a day or two.
Please let me know if you would like me to reach out to the movers. Just so you know, the piano is in excellent condition,it’s far from being something discarded or wasted

Summary: We are looking to give a loved piano a good home surrounded by art and appreciation.
Dear Katherine,
I have been past your address by someone on facebook where your piano was advertised.
My name is **** ***** and I am working with ***** *********, owner of ******** Gallery of **********. ***** has been in business here in D.C. since 1973 and during the summer we repainted and rehung the three story corner property on P Street and have started hosting some charity fundraising events within the gallery spaces.
We have been borrowing key boards and pianos which are then played by professional musicians and piano students from Howard University.
We have been inspired to find a piano to live with us after taking advice from a wonderful pianist called Dr ******* ******** (a nice story here if you can access instagram).
***** and I also have two young children who are nearly old enough to learn, and hope we will also be able to use this instrument to bring music into their lives.
My contact details are below (we are currently setting up a new website and emails hence my using my personal email).
I am very happy to speak on the phone or invite you to the gallery to see the space. If we were to move forward - we would want to visit the instrument with one of our regular student musicians to just check it out - as you know, specialist moving costs for such an instrument are significant and we have to be certain it will fit (!) and work for us.
If you google @lenfantgallery instagram you can see more images of the spaces. The size would depend if we can get it up the stairs or not.
